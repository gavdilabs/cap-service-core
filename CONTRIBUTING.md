## Contribution

- Bring your idea to a fix or a feature, or find one in the Issue Tracker!
- Clone the repository and create your own branch, named as cont-[feature|fix]-<name of fix/feature with spaces as underscore>-month-year - e.g. git checkout -b cont-feature-de_translation-02-2025 or git checkout -b cont-fix-injection_issue_data_loader-08-2024. Notice: If you are implementing a fix from the issue tracker use the issue number as the name, prefixed by #, e.g. git checkout -b cont-fix-#6403-10-2024
- Implement your changes, ensuring that you keep the code, methods and comments short and to the point
- Add and Update Unit Test (your code will not be approved without these)
- Make sure that you clearly state what you are committing in your commit message (and rather commit often with clear messages than committing a large, complex mess)
- Once you implemented the changes, tested the code, it quality and speed and verified that all unit tests are green Push the changes to the origin and do a Pull Request to the upstream repository, where you title the Pull Request the Feature/Fix you implemented
- Make requested changes if asked by the reviewer
- Receive a huge thanks and eternal appreciation from the team when your contribution is merged!
